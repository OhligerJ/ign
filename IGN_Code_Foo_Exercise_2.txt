IGN Code-Foo Exercise 2

1) Short/troll answer: a proper, lasting Golden Gate bridge could not be built entirely out of Legos, as the suspension cables built out of Legos would ultimately crack and strain under the  weight of the roadway and regular traffic combined with the lateral force of wind coming into or exiting the Golden Gate Strait. Lego material is just too rigid for what is called for there.

Longer Answer:

With some supplemental materials and engineering, I think it could be done. The simplest procedure would be to use modern traditional materials for suspension and cabling, and using the Legos only for the structure: the two towers, the roadway, and the supports. I say we need to use regular cabling from the roadway up to the suspension, as the "click" force of one Lego on top of another would be insufficient to hold up the weight of the roadway when it is attached to the suspension cable. Addtionally, we'd probably want to use concrete for the highway, even if we use Lego as the base.

Let us also consider the following statistic from http://goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBDesign.php: the weight of the relevant pieces of the bridge, i.e. the total weight of Bridge, anchorages, and approaches as of 1986 is 887,000 tons (804,700,000 kg, or 804,700,000,000 grams). Given steel's accepted density of 8.05 g/cm^3, we have a volume of 99,962,732,919.25466 cm^3 of material that we're replacing. A 2x8 Lego brick is 11.264 cm^3 in volume (source: http://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-brick-2-x-8-3007-93888). So divide total volume by the volume of one 2x8 brick, and we get 8,874,532,396.950875 bricks with 2x8 knob formation, rounding up to 8,874,532,397 bricks.

Further clarification may be required, as the precise dimensions of various beams, and the various strengths of the various bricks and their connections may require additional bricks beyond what would be recquired to reconstruct the Golden Gate bridge based simply on replicated the volume of materials of the bridge. For example, we may need to broaden the base of the two anchorages because Legos cannot handle the same pressure as the materials used at the base of the anchorages. And in the case of measurements being a little off, we may need to use 1x8, 2x4, or even 1x4 bricks instead of the 2x8s we are using in order to better approximate the dimensions of the objects we are replacing.
